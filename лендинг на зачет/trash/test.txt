                There's no sound<br>
                But the engines drone<br>
                Our minds set free<br>
                To roam<br>
                Time (shift)<br>
                We discover the entry<br>
                To other planes<br>
                Our minds bend<br>
                And our fingers fold<br>
                Entwined, we dream<br>
                Unknown<br>
                Time (shift)<br>
                We discover the entry<br>
                To other planes<br>
                Stay with me<br>
                As we cross the empty skies<br>
                Come sail with me<br>
                We slow down<br>
                As the engines stall
                Our eyes catch sync
                Explode
                Time (shift)
                We discover the entry
                To other planes
                Time (shift)
                As we collide with the energy
                In other ways
                Stay with me
                As we cross the empty skies
                Come sail with me
                We play in dreams
                As we cross through space and time
                Just stay with me
            </p>
